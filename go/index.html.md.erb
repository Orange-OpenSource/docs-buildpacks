## <a id='buildpack'></a>About the Go Buildpack ##

For information about using and extending the Go buildpack in Cloud Foundry, see
the [go-buildpack GitHub repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack).

You can find current information about this buildpack on the Go buildpack
[release page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases) in GitHub.

### Specifying a Go version

#### with Godeps

The Go version is saved in `Godeps.json` with the command `godep save`.

#### With .godir

Set the environment variable `GOVERSION` to specify a custom version. For example,
`cf set-env app-name GOVERSION 1.4.2`.

This buildpack uses a default Go version of `1.5.1` when used with the deprecated
`.godir` dependency management.
